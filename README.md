A game - Hangman, Strikingly Interview Test for iOS/Android engineer

Update: March 2nd 2014

This the hangman game I built in the past two days. The game includes 5 stages, “Initiate Game”, “Give Me A Word”, “Make A Guess”, “Get Test Results” & “Submit Test Results”. The folder also includes 5 screenshots.

For more detail, please refer https://github.com/joycehan/strikingly-interview-test-instructions-iOS/blob/master/README.md

Anyway, I got the rejection. Let me know if you get the offer from Strikingly.
